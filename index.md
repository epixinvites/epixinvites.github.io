I write guides based on my experience, and I explain the commands you're going to run. My main aim here is to educate people, and not spoonfeed information to people. Learn and not copy paste yea ;)

Edit: Most hyperlinks don't work yet, I haven't finished writing the guide. Sorry for the inconvenience.
